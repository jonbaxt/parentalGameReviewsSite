# Parental Gaming Reviews Site

## Purpose of the Site

Parents are always looking for ways to help their kids and protect them. This site is intended to help with that. The site takes data from IGDB.com's API to get game information, and has parent's review games and give recommendations if the game is suitable for kids or not.

## What's finished on the site

Database is able to show data now. Scores are calculated and information from database and parents are now being shown.

## Currently Under Construction

New posts to a game still being constructed. 
New games to be imported to the site for reviews is still under way.
Will need to get these done next.
